			<p><a id="tribute-link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C._V._Raman" title="raman's wiki" target="_blank">Sir Chandrashekhara Venkata Raman</a> was an Indian physicist born in the former Madras Province in India (presently the state of Tamil Nadu), who carried out ground-breaking work in the field of light scattering, which earned him the 1930 Nobel Prize for Physics and was the first person in Asia to obtain said award for achievements in science. He discovered that when light traverses a transparent material, some of the deflected light changes wavelength and amplitude. This phenomenon, subsequently known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raman_scattering" title="raman scattering effect" target="_blank">Raman scattering</a>, results from the <a href="#discovery" title="raman effect"> Raman effect</a>. In the year 1954, the Indian government honoured him with India's highest civilian award, the Bharat Ratna.
			</p>
			<p>C. V. Raman was born in Trichy, Tamil Nadu to Tamil Hindu parents, Chandrashekaran Ramanathan Iyer and Parvathi Ammal. Raman's father was a lecturer who taught mathematics and physics in Mrs A.V. Narasimha Rao College in Visakhapatnam (then Vishakapatnam) in the Indian state of Andhra Pradesh, and later joined Presidency College in Madras (now Chennai).
			</p>
			<p>At an early age, Raman moved to the city of Visakhapatnam and studied at St Aloysius Anglo-Indian High School. Raman passed matriculation at age 11 and the FA examination with a scholarship at age 13.
			</p>
			<p>In 1902, Raman joined Presidency College in Madras where his father was a Lecturer in Mathematics and Physics. In 1904 he obtained a BA degree from the University of Madras, where he stood first and won the gold medal in Physics. In 1907 he completed an MSc degree at the University of Madras with highest distinction.

			<h2>11 interesting facts about Sir C V Raman:</h2>
			<hr>
				<ol>
					<li>Raman quit his government service; he was appointed the first Palit Professor of Physics at the University of Calcutta in 1917.</li>
					<li>While he was teaching at the University of Calcutta, Raman continued his research at the Indian Association for the Cultivation of Science (IACS) in Calcutta. He later became an honorary scholar at the association.</li>
					<li>At the IACS, Raman did a ground-breaking experiment that eventually earned him the Nobel Prize in Physics on February 28 in 1928. He discovered the evidence of the quantum nature of light by observing the scattering of light, an effect that came to be known as the Raman Effect. The day is celebrated as National Science Day in India.</li>
					<li>Not known by many, Raman had a collaborator in this experiment. K S Krishnan, Raman's co-worker, did not share the Nobel Prize due to some professional differences between the two. However, Raman strongly mentioned Krishnan's contributions in his Nobel acceptance speech.</li>
					<li>Discoverer of atomic nucleus and proton, Dr Ernest Rutherford referred to Raman's spectroscopy in his presidential address to the Royal Society in 1929. Raman was acknowledged by the society and he was also presented with a knighthood.</li>
					<li>Raman had been hoping for a Nobel Prize since 1928. After two years of wait, he bagged the award "for his work on the scattering of light and for the discovery of the Raman Effect". He was so eager that he had booked tickets to Sweden in July to receive the award in November.</li>
					<li>Raman was the first Asian and non-white individual to win a Nobel Prize in science.</li>
					<li>In 1932, Raman and Suri Bhagavantam discovered the quantum photon spin. This discovery further proved the quantum nature of light.</li>
					<li>When asked about his inspiration behind the Nobel Prize-winning optical theory, Raman said he was inspired by the "wonderful blue opalescence of the Mediterranean Sea" while he was going to Europe in 1921.</li>
					<li>Raman was not only an expert on light, he also experimented with acoustics. Raman was the first person to investigate the harmonic nature of the sound of Indian drums such as tabla and mridangam.</li>
					<li>On his first death anniversary, the Indian Postal Service published a commemorative stamp of Sir C V Raman with the reading of his spectroscopy and a diamond in the background. He was also awarded the Bharat Ratna in 1954.</li>
